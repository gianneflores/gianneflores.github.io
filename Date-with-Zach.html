                    I haven't seen Zach in I think an entire month? I'm not sure exactly when the last time I 
                    saw him was but it's been a whooleeee minute. I'm terrible at buying gifts for him, but I'll also blame him
                    for not really wanting anything/his mom buys him everything anyways. The idea of me giving him just 
                    Chic-Fil-A gift cards seemed really sad so I wanted to take him out so we could do things together. As two poor
                    college students we didn't do any super cool things but being able to hang out with him and doing things together was
                    enough for the both of us.

                    Our day consisted of eating, art, and floofers. We ate lunch at Jimmy Hulas! It was my first time eating there and 
                    it was pretty good, not super dank but that's okay. I had a bowl with rice, beans and shrimp, and some sauce.
                    As an asian I LOVE my rice and I mean I love it. I can't eat a meal unless I have it. HOWEVER they put too much 
                    rice and not enough shrimp. For these bowls you could put in different meat, like chicken, pork or shrimp. Usually 
                    in places that let you pick your meat the shrimp is more $$$$$$ sooo I usually never get the shrimps. BUT they were 
                    the same price so I appreciated that :D. They had these really good fries that I think had some kind of lemon spice 
                    in it and let me tell you WHAT. Those fries were really good and super different compared to the other fries I've had. 
                    So that was dank.

                    We also went to the Orlando Museum of Art and if you're a student, admissions were only $5!!! AMAZING. I'm pretty sure 
                    we got like a $10 discount. Maybeeeeee, I'll just keep my UF ID even after I graduate. LIFE HACKS. Amazing. Anywhoooo
                    I really like art and appreciate all kinds of them, even abstract art. If it makes people mad then I think the artwork did its job of 
                    getting people to feel an emotion. All I'm saying art is cool and everyone has their own style and I like that.

                    The mueseum was really fun. We kept making memes/jokes with the art. We are def very classy B-). I wish the mueseum was one of those interactive ones where you're able to touch and press things. Other than that, OMA is a nice place to go that is not very expensive. They also switch out the artworks so you don't see the same things everytime you visit. They should definitly have 
                    more sculpture artworks though.

                    We end the day with the best. THE FLOOFERS. We went to a dog store in downtown and held some puppies. However, I'm not
                    sure if the store is really good. And when I mean good I mean, I'm really just questioning how they treat the puppies. 
                    I don't know where they go once the store closes. Buutttt....I also love puppies T.T So that was my day with Zach. So goood
                    to see him and be with him. And I only spent like $33 for the entire day and I paid for everything. Get you a sugar mama like me 
                    B-)
