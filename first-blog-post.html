                    Warning: I am not the best writer so bear with me and my grammar mistakes. Also I'm not going to write 
                    in proper english. IMMA DO WHAT I WANT :-)

                    Wow. My first blog. Happy 0th bday bloggy :3. I plan to write a lot of different topics and such on my blog.
                    Though the whole point of my website is more for "professional" reasons, I hope to
                    to blend the buisness side of things with the casual. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I don't really think many people will read my blog, and honestly I don't mind. I'm not
                    writing to seek attention or in hopes that my blog will reach thousands of readers. I 
                    wasn't one to write in diaries as a child, though I did have a journal where I wrote in once
                    every 6 months or so. And as I said before I am not the best writer.....honestly, I hate writing. 
                    I am terrible at grammar, people think I word things weirdly, and I have to go through many iterations 
                    just to make sure what I wrote makes any sense. Even though I hate writing with an intense passion, I don't
                    want that to stop me from making a blog. So since I am not submitting my blog to a very well known 
                    journal, I'll be able to write as I please without being toatlly patronized. AnD i CaN wRiTe anYWay I WANT.
                    I also want to be able to get my personality through these blogposts. So I'm sure my writing style will change as I write more blog posts. Most posts I've read are pretty professional and the authors write really well, which is a skill
                    I don't have. I do like the "chillness" of articles written by like Buzzfeed so, that will probably influence how I write?? Maybe? Idk.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Anyways, other than using my free will to write whatever I want and however I want, I do hope to be able to capture my 
                    thoughts, happiness, issues, and all the in betweens I will go through as I'm about to start my life as an adult. 
                    Which is the is the entire reason why I want to make a blog in the first place because, I want to be able to one day look back at
                    what I did/how I felt. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    People don't care about how other people write in their personal journals (probably because it's a personal journal and they probably don't show anyone else lol). So I guess my blog is more of a personal journal that is open 
                    to anyone who stumbles upon it. I hope thinking like that helps me be confident in what I write and how I write and to post it 
                    regardless of what people will think. Sometimes you just gotta do you and not give a care of what others think B-).
