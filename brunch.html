                    I finally got to hang out with Katie!!!! I have no idea when the last time we hung out was. 
                    Anyways we started our day eating brunch at Keke's. Katie has never been there and I haven't been there 
                    in a while (I've been there once). The food is pretty expensive though :/, but I guess that's every restaraunt.
                    (WHY THINGS GOTTA COST $$$$$$$$ ?!?!?!?!?).? I ordered a banana pecan waffle, bacon, and potatoes wedges. The food was really gooodd though and because there was a brunch of food (hehehe see what I did there) it was super filling. Super dank, very good! Would recommend. As a food enthusiast I give it a rating of 10/10.

                    Soooo we used to have "friendship bracelets" however, something terrible happend. Since we 
                    never took them off they broke. I mean our bracelet was a red string. Dassit. But since both of our "friendship" bracelets broke we went to the mall after Keke's in hopes to find new friendship bracelets. In the end we couldn't find anything we wanted. We wanted a bracelet that we didn't have to take off so it couldn't be those cheap "gold/silver" bracelets. If we kept those on and showered with them our entire wrist would probably be green anddddd we don't want that. We did however, ended up buying hats at Hot Topic. I got a mint hat with pusheen! It's such a cute hat and I don't have a hat in that color. I think it was really funny how we got stuff at Hot Topic. Not that there's anything wrong with Hot Topic
                    but the store has a middle school emo vibe. Honestly, I think my hat is kind of childish looking, but because of
                    that I really like it. There's also another store that is kind of similar to Hot Topic just less emo called,
                    Box Lunch. HOWEVER, the stuff at Box Lunch is more expensive than Hot Topic. So don't buy things off Box Lunch
                    all willy nilly becuase you might find it cheaper in hot topic.

                    We also went to the Apple store and started drawing on the iPads which was really fun. I want an iPad and an
                    apple pen. Such a greatttt combo. Having a tablet so I can draw things on Photoshop would be just as good though. 
                    We also went to it's competing store, Microsoft. We played Fortnite on their PCs. I STILL SUCK AT IT but it's way 
                    easier to play on PC than console. So I'm basically a gamer. Follow me on twitch ;-)
