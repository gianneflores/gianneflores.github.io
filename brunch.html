                    I finally got to hang out with Katie!!!! I have no idea when the last time we hung out was. 
                    Anyways we started our day eating brunch at Keke's. Katie has never been there and I haven't been there 
                    in a while so it was a good restaraunt to go to for the both of us. The food was pretty expensive though :/, but I guess that's every restaraunt. (WHY THINGS GOTTA COST $$$$$$$$ ?!?!?!?!?).? I ordered a banana pecan waffle, bacon, and potatoes wedges. The food was really gooodd and because there was a brunch of food (hehehe see what I did there) it was super filling. Super dank, very good! Would recommend. As a food enthusiast I give it a rating of 10/10.

                    Soooo we used to have "friendship bracelets" and when I say friendship bracelets I mean a red string. But since our bracelent
                    broke we decided to go look for some new ones at the mall. In the end we couldn't find something that worked for us. We were
                    looking for something very durable because we wanted to be able to never take off the bracelet. Buying those cheap gold/silver bracelets would be cool and super fashionable but in the end we knew that the metal would oxidized and turn our wrist green or
                    something Which was NOT what we wanted. We did end up buying hats at Hot Topic, I got a mint hat with Pusheen on it and Katie
                    got a black hat with a corgi on it. I really like my hat, even though it kind of looks like a hat an elementary girl would wear. For some reason I really the hat because of that???? Weird? Yeah, probably. I do think it's kind of funny how we both got stuff from Hot Topic because I feel like the only people that buy things there are emo middle schoolers lol. There's also another store that is kind of similar to Hot Topic just less emo called, Box Lunch. HOWEVER, the stuff at Box Lunch is more expensive than Hot Topic. So don't but stuff right away from Box Lunch because you becuase you might find it cheaper in Hot Topic.

                    We also went to the Apple store and started drawing on the iPads which was really fun and just really makes me
                    want iPad and an apple pen. Such a greatttt combo. Having a tablet so I can draw things on Photoshop would be just as good though. We also went to it's competing store, Microsoft. A store that I've never been to because why would I? I only have Apple
                    products. We did watch some people play Fortnite and I also played on their PCs. I STILL SUCK AT IT but it's way 
                    easier to play on PC than a console. So I'm basically a gamer and you should follow me on twitch ;-)
