                         I haven't seen my boyfriend, Zach in I think an entire month? I'm not sure exactly when the last time I 
                    saw him was but it's been a whooleeee minute. I'm terrible at buying gifts for him, but I'll also blame him
                    for not really wanting anything/his mom buys him everything anyways. The idea of me giving him just 
                    Chic-Fil-A gift cards seemed really sad so I wanted to take him out so we could do things together. As two poor
                    college students we didn't do any super cool things but being able to hang out with him and doing things together was
                    enough for the both of us.<a href="Date-with-Zach.html">[...] </a>

                        Wow. My first blog. I plan to write a lot of different topics and such on my blog.
                        Though the whole point of my website is more for "professional" reasons, I hope to
                        to blend the buisness side of things with the casual.

                        I don't really think many people will read my blog, and honestly I don't mind. I'm not
                        writing to seek  <a href="first-blog-post.html">[...]</a>
