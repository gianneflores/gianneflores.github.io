                         I finally got to hang out with Katie!!!! I have no idea when the last time we hung out was. 
                    Anyways we started our day eating brunch at Keke's. Katie has never been there and I haven't been there 
                    in a while so it was a good restaraunt to go to for the both of us. The food was pretty expensive though :/, but I guess that's every restaraunt. (WHY THINGS GOTTA COST $$$$$$$$ ?!?!?!?!?).? I ordered a banana pecan waffle, bacon

                        So I haven't seen Zach in I think an entire month? I'm not sure exactly when the last time I 
                    saw him was but it's been a whooleeee minute. I'm also terrible at buying gifts for him, but I'll just blame him
                    for not really wanting anything/his mom buys him everything anyways ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . He does love Chic-Fil-A so I got
                    him gift cards from there but the idea of me giving him just CFA gift cards seems really lame so I wanted to take 
                    him out so we could do things together. As two poor college students we didn't do any super cool things but being 
                    able to go out and spend time with him was <a href="Date-with-Zach.html">[...] </a>

                    Wow. My first blog. Happy 0th bday bloggy :3. I plan to write a lot of different topics and such on my blog.
                    Though the whole point of my website is more for "professional" reasons, I hope to
                    to blend the buisness side of things with the casual. <a href="first-blog-post.html">[...]</a>
